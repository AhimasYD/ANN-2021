"The budget is visible in everything, and this concerns artistic implementation, not technical capabilities. The film certainly does not cause wild disgust, it is quite watchable, dynamic, with more or less lively actors (who really play, and do not utter pathetic speeches with a fixed expression), with streams of blood and what is most interesting, comical and parodic. And at the same time, it is absolutely not a successful film adaptation. The most important element is missing, without which everything is meaningless - there is no tournament, there are just chaotic clashes of opponents (although the existence of the outer and earthly worlds is described in detail and the rules of the game are announced) and there is no convincing atmosphere and faith in the reality of what is happening (which was actually famous for the old dilogy). A monotonous cold color, no colors and everything faded, terrible heavy costumes, some "garbage" scenery-the action is in barns, in some mines, or even in some landfill.
