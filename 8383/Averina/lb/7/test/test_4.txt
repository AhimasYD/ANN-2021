Recently, while typing in a search engine something like "existential comedies", I came across the series "High with delivery". Despite the high rating among film critics, it is not at all popular with the Russian-speaking audience. Maybe because of the translation (it sounds like another stupid comedy), or maybe because of the fact that viewing requires some tolerance, liberality in views (n-r, on the use of marijuana). But anyway, the series turned out to be absolutely wonderful. The plot is simple — the main character," the guy with the weed " delivers marijuana to customers, each episode is the story of a new client.
The movie is both sad and funny, without complicated ideas and pretentious messages. About ordinary people and about life that just happens. A kaleidoscope of life stories. The main character is a very real character (he, by the way, is played by the director himself), well, just a guy from the next street. He often gets into a little ridiculous situations — you look and do not know how to react: laughter and sadness, sympathy and Spanish shame — and often all at the same time. And his bike rides around New York City to music are a meditation that deserves special attention.
I wonder why I was so hooked on the show? First of all, the mood. There is something Japanese about it, some elusive zen, a reminder-from which you want to stop, cancel all urgent matters and go for a walk in the nearest park, enjoy nature, a walk and pleasant company-simple joys.
I like that the author does not have a clear message for the viewer, I think everyone will have their own message. For me, this is about celebrating life, about the versatility of life stories, about beauty in the ordinary.
