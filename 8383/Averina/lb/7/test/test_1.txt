The film is simply great! Best movie I've ever seen. Everything is great. And the script, and directing, and special effects, well, the music… Hans Zimmer did his best (standing ovation)! The actors also played well… Everything is great. The only thing Nolan picked up a little bit… I immediately noticed this (although of course it is clear that this was done for the "piquancy" of the script and the logic of what is happening)... In a dream, time goes not slower, but faster than in reality. Well, for example. How much do you sleep at night?... Maybe 7-8 hours?… But you do not see a dream for 15-16 hours, but only a few minutes (usually 2-3 minutes), or even less than a minute! In the film, the hero DiCaprio explains to the girl that 5 minutes of sleep in reality is equal to several hours in a dream! And, consequently, the more levels of sleep, the slower time goes (who watched-will understand what I mean)! It's almost like this.
