I've wanted to watch this film so bad and after sitting through it I can say that it was way beyond what expected.
Never I've seen such diverse cast of characters and deep storyline as in the No Country For Old Man. Film catches you from the 
first frame and never let you down. It is all here: evil, pleasantly disgusting and cruel main villain, cowboy-like protagonist
and, of course, the old man himself, who can't handle the events of this story. I can't recommend this film enough.
