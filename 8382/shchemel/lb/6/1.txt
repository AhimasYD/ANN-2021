I felt it was poorly written plot. I felt as if I had joined a movie mid showing as everything was like already a story line in progress and no one had bothered to introduce said story lines. I left the theater feeling as if all they wanted was to get my money one last time. What they state in the preview is the ENTIRE movie, no need to watch it, it dragged very slowly during much of the film. at one point I left to go to the bathroom, got back and still nothing had changed, no action, no nothing but another slow scene. And to add this was set in the late 2020s? I thought from the last movie there was a teaser set near the same time when Professor X and Magneto came for Logan at an airport. what happened there? is this a prequel? many many more questions arose rather than answer. If this is in fact a prequel, than this fact will make me want to wait till all episodes are in and watch them in entirety then maybe it'll make sense. As it is this wasn't very well written and they writers did little to no homage to the previous X-Men franchise movies. They left out completely what had happened other than a reference or 2 to an "event". I don't know I felt like it wasn't worth a theater show, straight to DVD maybe but not a huge success IMO.
