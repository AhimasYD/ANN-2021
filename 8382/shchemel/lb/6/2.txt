The movie was quite depressing. Logan and Charles have aged, and are not doing well. They are hiding out and keeping Charles drugged so he won't hurt anyone.

I just didn't like the violence for the sake of violence in the movie. Most of the super hero movies were rated PG-13, now we have another one that is rated R. There one flash of brief nudity, so we could have that added to the rating of the movie, that did nothing to add to the plot of the movie.

The movie seemed to go out of its way to kill anything that brought a moment of pleasure to heroes of the story.

They don't give Laura's age in the movie, but the actress is 11 years old. Having her kill people over and over and throwing a severed head to the leader of the villains is just going a bit overboard.
