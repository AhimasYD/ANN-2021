This film is absolutely brilliant. The makers of the Harry Potter franchise finally pulled themselves together, and made something awesome. I am a huge fan of the books, but I haven't been a real fan of the films, because they've been constantly disappointing me. I've read all the books at least five times, so I now them almost word for word, so maybe that's why the other films (especially the fourth one) were such disappointments for me. But this one, the eighth film in the series, was everything I could hope for.

It was true to the book, the visuals were striking, the acting was over the top, the music was moving and the script was (finally) well-adapted. Maybe all these things are due to the fact that J. K. Rowling was an executive producer on this. I liked that there were some funny moments and some extra action in the movie which weren't in the book, but I missed one thing they left out. I won't tell you what it is, because I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it yet (shame on you! go see it).

I'm glad John Williams didn't come back for this film to compose, Alexandre Desplat's music is so full of emotions and has great tunes. I actually cried at one scene (because of the music and Alan Rickman's great acting), although films don't usually have that effect on me anymore.

All in all the film was great fun, in some way better than the book, so for a Potter fan it's a must see.
