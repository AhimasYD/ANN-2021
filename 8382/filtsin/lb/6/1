Wow, what a masterpiece!! Really enjoyed this movie, full of action, great dialogues and perfect acting not forgetting the wonderful choice of soundtracks. A very unique movie which has similar taste to the John Wick franchise but more exciting with some family action and moments. A little bit short in length but worth every scene. Bob did a wonderful job in this movie and suited him perfectly for the role, wish to see him in more action like this. I highly recommend this movie to every John Wick fan, action or intense and realistic fight sequences... With a purchase to the collection
