The movie was a disappointment for me. I saw the trailer for the movie before I saw the actual movie itself. I thought this movie would be more like a vigilante movie and I love these sort of movies.

But in effect this was more of a dumb backstory kind of generic Hollywood movies dished out. This follows the same case as John Wick. The first John Wick was good, but they killed it with the sequels. They should have stopped after the first one. "I Am Wrath" is also another good movie and better than this one.

I have already seen good vigilante movies in the past. Death Wish and The Exterminator are prime examples of good movies that have survived into the present era. Vigilante 1983 starring the late Robert Forster and Fighting Back 1982 starring Tom Skerrit are also terrific.

In Nobody(2021), the story follows a family man played by Bob Odenkirk(of Breaking Bad fame) who fails to stop some inept burglars from stealing his possessions. After which he has a change of heart and lashes out vigilante-style to vent out his anger. The rest of the movie deals with repercussions of his decisions.

The acting in the movie is so-so. The direction and background music and sound-effects is typical of a generic Hollywood action thriller. Overall this movie was a real waste of my time and I would never recommend you to watch it. See all of the above movies I have listed above.
