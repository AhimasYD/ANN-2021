I was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype. I actually didn't enjoy watching this movie. there was no message, it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying. I don't see how anyone could relate to this character and the laughing is lame acting way overdone. I'm just stunned that this has a 9/10 rating right now, how the hell
