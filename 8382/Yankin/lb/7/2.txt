This TV Mini-series is excellent! It is wonderful to see Anya Taylor-Joy in a well crafted show. She shines brilliantly as Beth Harmon a chess playing prodigy. The story takes us from when she is a small girl, orphaned, continuing through her teenage angst years. I highly recommend this show. Great cinematography and directing and of course to get back to the acting - its top notch! I only wish there was more than 7 episodes.
