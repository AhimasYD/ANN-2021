Started off with promise, but ended up being a not-very-interesting soap opera. I can only watch a pretty girl get drunk and dance around so many times in seven episodes before I start to notice all of the huge, gaping, ridiculous holes in the plot, like the fact that the main character experiences at least 5 lives worth of tragedy in about 7 years. This way, she's can still look gorgeous through the whole thing is the point, I guess. Episode 6 in particular is just bad.
