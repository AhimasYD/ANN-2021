I would like to put in a separate word to the natural beauty of Crimea - this is where the spectacle and beauty is such that it takes your breath away. At such moments, when they showed the sea, mountains, winding roads, stones (who looked, remembered the scene of shooting from a flying camera), I remembered my trip to the Crimea, when we walked hundreds of kilometers, photographed the landscapes in plenty and forever preserved love in my heart for this wonderful the peninsula. These scenes went through thoroughly.
As for the love story, it was sweet. Cute but not super spectacular. I was missing something, unfortunately. I wanted more anguish, suffering, passion, some frank scenes. Why not? We are all adults. But what was shown was quite enough.
In general, I liked the film. There are, of course, a couple of comments, but you can't please everyone. I didnâ€™t regret spending my money on going to the movies and not waiting for the movie to appear on the Internet.
